A PHP package for building CSS stylesheets programmatically.

## Why?

I mean, you can already write CSS using JavaScript, so why not PHP? PHP has a distinct advantage over JavaScript, in
that it isn't JavaScript.

### License

This package inherits the licensing of its parent framework, Laravel, and as such is open-sourced
software licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
